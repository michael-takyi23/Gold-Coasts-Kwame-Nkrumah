## Features Left to Implement

- In the future I want to implement the hamburger drop down menu for smaller devices to enable easy accessibility to save enough space on screens.

## Testing

The website has been tested on various devices ( desktop, tablet, and mobile ) to ensure compatibility and responsiveness. HTML and CSS code has been validated using the W3C Markup Validation Service to avoid any syntax or structural issues.

### Validator Testing

- HTML: No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/).
- CSS: No errors were returned when passing through the official ( Jigsaw ) validator.
- Accessibility: I confirmed that the colors and fonts chosen are easy to read and accessible by running it through lighthouse in devtools.

### Bugs
- I realised that when I scroll to the right on mobile devices, there is white space on the right side of the page especially the header which i have tried to adjust but the problem persisted.
- I realised I had added width to the footer and a margin of 1em to the header element.
- removing the width of the footer and the margin of 1em from the header for screens 768px and 468px solved fixed the problem.
