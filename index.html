                <p>Kwame Nkrumah was born on <strong>21 September 1909</strong> in Nkroful, Gold Coast, now Ghana.
                 At that time the so-called Gold Coast was a crown colony of Great Britain. Kwame Nkruhmah went to a missionary school and graduated from Accra's Achimota College in <strong>1930</strong>.
                He travelled to the United States for further education in <strong>October 1935</strong>. He gained admission at Lincoln University.
                He gained a Bachelor of Theology degree from Lincoln in <strong>1942</strong>. The following year Nkrumah received a Master of Arts in philosophy and a Master of
                Science in education in <strong>1943</strong> from the University of Pennsylvania. 
                In <strong>1945</strong> Kwame Nkrumah studied in London.</p>

                <hr class="custom-hr">
                <p>Nkrumah returned to the Gold Coast in <strong>1947</strong> and became Secretary General of the United Gold Coast
                Convention party, UGCC. He took part in many riots, and soon became a nationally known hero. He
                then formed the more radical Convention People's Party CPP, which called for immediate autonomy for the Gold Coast.
                It became the strongest party in the 1951 general election. In March <strong>1952</strong>, Nkrumah was elected Prime Minister.
                In 1957 Nkrumah managed to achieve independence from Britain. Gold Coast became the first of Britain's African colonies to gain independence.
                Nkrumah named the country Ghana. He was hailed as the <em>Osagyefo</em>   which means "redeemer" 
                in the Akan langauge. </p>

            <h2>President of Ghana and Beyond  <i class="fa-solid fa-earth-africa"></i></h2>
            <hr class="custom-hr">
            <p>In <strong>1960</strong> Ghana became a republic and Kwame Nkrumah became its president, with wide legislative and executive powers under
            a new constitution.The period of Nkrumah's active political involvement has been described as the "golden age of high pan-African
            ambitions" seeing the movement as the "quest for regional integration of the whole of the African continent". Nkrumah
            then concentrated his attention on campaigning for the political unity of Black Africa.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, the economic crisis in Ghana worsened and shortages of foodstuffs and other goods became chronic.</p>
            <p>In <strong>1966</strong>, while Nkrumah was on a foreign trip in Beijing, the military staged a coup in Ghana and the pro-Western Nation
            Liberation Council party came to power.The CIA, the US foreign intelligence agency, backed the coup on the grounds that
            Nkrumah would enrich himself as a socialist dictator.</p>
            <p>Nkrumah never returned to Ghana, but he continued to push for his vision of African unity. He lived in exile in Guinea
            Conakry where he spent the remainder of his life as the guest of President Ahmed Sekou Touré, who made him honorary
            co-president of the country. He died of cancer at the age of 62 while in Bucharest, Romania in <strong>1972</strong>.</p>
            <p>Nkrumah continued to author a number of books with titles such as "Dark Days in Ghana"and "Class Struggle in Africa".</p>
            <p>Although the new rulers after Nkrumah's fall tried to erase his memory by destroying statues and renaming streets,
            schools and universities, he remained in people's minds as the man who led Ghana to independence.
            </p>
            <P>Even today, Kwame Nkrumah is celebrated as a national hero.</P>
