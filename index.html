                <p>Kwame Nkrumah was born on <strong>21 September 1909</strong> in Nkroful,Gold Coast,now Ghana.
                 At that time the so-called Gold Coast was a crown colony of Great Britain. Kwame Nkruhmah went to a missionary school and graduated from Accra's Achimota College in <strong>1930</strong>.
                He travelled to the United States for further education in <strong>October 1935</strong>. He gained admission at Lincoln University.
                He gained a Bachelor of Theology degree from Lincoln in <strong>1942</strong>. The following year Nkrumah received a Master of Arts in philosophy and a Master of
                Science in education in <strong>1943</strong> from the University of Pennsylvania. 
                In <strong>1945</strong> Kwame Nkrumah studied in London. There, his political commitment grew steadily.</p>

                <p>Kwame Nkrumah returned to the Gold Coast in <strong>1947</strong> and became Secretary General of the moderate party, the United Gold Coast
                Convention UGCC. He took part in many riots, and soon became a nationally known hero. He
                then formed the more radical Convention People's Party CPP, which called for immediate autonomy for the Gold Coast.
                It became the strongest party in the 1951 general election. In March <strong>1952</strong>, Nkrumah was elected Prime Minister.
                In 1957 Nkrumah managed to achieve independence from Britain. Gold Coast became the first of Britain's African colonies to gain independence.
                Nkrumah named the country Ghana. He was hailed as the <em>Osagyefo</em> which means "redeemer" 
                in the Akan langauge. </p>
